\subsection{Problem Statement}
The school of electrical and information engineering currently has a paper based postgraduate approval process. The current process involves of printing out all relevant documentation and manually passing on to different actors. Some documents may get lost in the process and may cause for applications to be rejected. The manual process is also not environmentally friendly. Due to this manual process, there is a delay on the decision of the applications. The EIE requires an online application approval system to solve these issues.
\subsection{Project Overview}
Our aim for the project is to create an online postgraduate application approval system for the school of electrical and information engineering. This system will be completely paperless to keep the paperwork of the activity to a minimum.
The PGO will receive completed applications from students and required documents from SIMS.
These applications will be checked to make sure they are ready to process. Once they are checked,
the applications with the required information can be sent to one of the three users that will either
recommend or not recommend an application. The three actors are the Research Group Lead, Identified Supervisor and the PGC. The application will be sent to either one of these actors based on the program
that the application is for. If an interview is needed, one of the three actors can book an interview
with the applicant. After the interview the user can recommend/not recommend the application. The
application will then be sent to the PGC who will then accept or reject the application based on the
the application being recommended or not and based on faculty rules and regulations. The PGFO
will receive an email/notification about the application's status. The applicant and the schools PGO
will also receive an email notifying them whether the application was accepted or rejected with an explanation.

\section{Software Requirement Specification}
\subsection{Overall Description}
\subsubsection{Product Perspective}
The solution we are developing will be a web application. This web application will be used by the employees of the EIE who are responsible for the postgraduate approval process of applicants to their graduate program. \\
Our solution, the Postgraduate Application Approval System (PAAS), will provide these employees with an almost completely paperless electronic way of approving postgraduate applicants. \\
The PAAS will be designed to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Send notification emails to PGO about applications that need to be processed.
\item Receive and view applications and associated documents.
\item Forward documents to Evaluator (Research Group Leads, Identified Supervisors or PGCs).
\item Create interviews for applicant and notify them by email.
\item Allow applications to be recommended by Evaluators.
\item Send application to PGC.
\item Allow PGC to accept/decline application.
\item Send the accepted/declined applications back to PGO.
\item Send notification email to PGFO.
\item Send email to applicant whether he/she has been accepted.
\item Print documents if needed at any time.
\item Login users.
\item Create users.
\item Update users if needed.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Requirements Gathering}
Brainstorming: We got together as a group and identifying as many possible solutions to the problem that the EIE is facing. We then simplified the solution details. Brainstorming helps casts a broad net, determining various discrete possibilities. Then simplifying and prioritizing the details of the solution. [2] \\ \\
Observation: We were given a step-by-step walkthrough of the business process, which we believe is a more subjective form of obtaining requirements than pure observation. We then took those steps and converted them into functions for the PAAS. [2]
\subsubsection{Use Cases}
We will be converting what the PAAS is designed to do into use cases. \\
Main Use Case List: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Create Application
\item Read Document
\item Create Interview
\item Recommend Application
\item Accept Application
\item Login User \\
\end{itemize}
Secondary Use Case List: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Print Document \\
\end{itemize}
CRUD (Create, Read [View], Update [Edit], Delete [Archive]) Use Case List:
\begin{itemize}
\item ie. Manage PGO = Create PGO, View PGO, Update PGO, Archive PGO
\item Manage PGO 
\item Manage PGC
\item Manage PGFO
\item Manage Evaluator (Research Group Lead or Identified Supervisor)
\item Manage Application
\item Manage Interview
\item Manage Document
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{User Characteristics}
The users are the people and other systems that interact with the PAAS system. A user can be primary user or a secondary user. A primary user interacts directly with the PAAS and a secondary user interacts with the PAAS indirectly. \\ \\

\end{tabular}
\subsubsection{General Constraints}
\textbf{Implementation} \\ 
Not all internet browsers may work with our system. Moving from manual to digital may be time consuming, and are subject to human error. The number of active users may start out small due to human resistance towards new technology, especially those who are not computer savvy. Teaching new users how to use the system will be time-consuming. \\ \\
Due to time constraints and the fact that we are students, the system may not be fully-functional as planned. \\ \\ \\
\textbf{Hardware} \\
Any device that makes use of a supported browser will be able to use the system. We cannot guarantee that all devices will be supported. \\ \\
The system will require an internet connection. \\ \\ \\
\textbf{Software}\\
One needs a supported browser. There will not be an application available for mobile or computer, because it is a web-application. \\ \\
The software may not be fully implemented as planned due to the fact that we are students and have time constraints. \\ \\ \\
\textbf{Legal Issues} \\
To obtain a web domain. The source code will belong to the University and therefore, if the client wants the rights to the source code, they might have to go through legal protocols to obtain it from Wits University. \\ \\
As students we may not be given permission to access SIMS. \\ \\ \\
\textbf{Reliability and Fault Tolerance} \\
The system needs to be reliable and should be able to recover the student documents. It is extremely frustrating for applicants to re-upload applications because of the unreliability of the system.  \\ \\
The system also needs have as little faults as possible, since we are working with an important process at the university, this process cannot be put on hold because of a faulty system. \\ \\ \\
\textbf{Security} \\
The system is working with sensitive information and cannot be compromised. Student details and marks are very private pieces of data and cannot be leaked because of a poorly designed system. \\ \\ \\
\textbf{User} \\
Based on the security issue mentioned above, users will only be able to access the system with a username and password. Therefore users should not have access to other users' data. \\ \\
The PGO should not have access to make the final decision until the recommendation for the application is received from the relevant users. \\ 
\subsubsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
\item We are assuming all users have a supported browser.
\item We are assuming that all applicants are Wits students (because of time constraints we are not regarding non-Wits student applicants).
\item We are assuming all users are computer literate. 
\item The system will be dependent on a local database.
\item We are assuming that all applicants and users use email actively.
\item We are assuming that all users may need to print the application documents.
\item We are assuming that PGO is in charge of creating users.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Detailed Requirements}
\subsubsection{External Interface Requirements} 
\textbf{Interfaces} \\
The user interfaces may be different depending on what type of user is logged into the system. But all interfaces will follow some fundamental UX principles.
Some of these UX principles are digestibility, clarity, trust, familiarity and delight. Digestibility gives the user the feeling of “I get it”. The format, components and layout of the interface should be as clear as possible so that the user can have a feeling knowing exactly what to do because of past experiences and familiarity. Clarity is used in terms of the components, fields, layout, validation, error messages and format. The formats, validation and error messages have to be clear in terms of language, ie. “the field requires a valid email address”. A user should never feel unsure when entering their details. The use of components such as date-time picker gives the user a feeling clarity and trust. The users of the PAAS should have a feeling of familiarity from the previous forms that used to fill in manually. The electronic forms should be designed around the manual forms, the formats and positions need to be as similar as possible to allow for an easier transition. A user should have a feeling of delight when using the system, they should never feel frustrated because this will lead to the users being reluctant to using the system. \cite{product-design} \\ \\
\textbf{Hardware Interfaces} \\
Since this solution is a web-based application, the hardware devices used must support the use of web browsers, as well as the ability to display a GUI and process input from the user in order to perform the interactions between client and server. To display the GUI of the application, a display device must be used, preferably with a DPI (dots per inch) above 300. If the DPI of the device is too low, the GUI may be too pixelated to view or give meaning to. For input, a keyboard is required. It may be a digitally displayed keyboard (on the display of a device) or a physical external keyboard. The keyboard is required for basic functionality of the application. Also on the aspect of input, a mouse or trackpad is required in order to perform basic mouse down functions as well as cursor movement. The device must have sufficient processing power and memory in order to run the web browser which will be the host of the web application on the device.  \\ \\
\textbf{Software Interfaces} \\
The software used for this web-based application will be web browsers. The web browsers which this application’s functionality will be tested on are FireFox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and the mobile versions of these. As discussed above, the hardware devices need to be able to support FireFox, Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome web browsers.\\  \\
\textbf{Communication Interfaces} \\
The system will make use of email functionality to notify the users, both primary and secondary. The email function is used to notify applicants about the status about their application. The PGO will receive emails when there are new applications to be processes.

\subsubsection{Performance Requirements}
This application is more dependent on the accuracy of communication and information than it is dependent on the overall performance and speed of the application. We aim to have a reliable platform on which communication is priority. Although performance is not negligible, it is not a requirement at the expense of a loss of accuracy in the communication between applicant and PGO. The application will not be demanding on the hardware but it will be demanding on the bandwidth available to the device. The slower the connection to the server where the database is stored, the slower the overall interaction with the web app will be.
\subsubsection{Design Constraints}
The application will not be optimized for systems that run Safari browsers since there are no such devices available to our team for testing. Running the web application on a safari browser is not recommended and will be done at the user's own risk. \\ \\
We have a major time constraint, since we are students, we have other obligations as well. Therefore the application design could suffer from this design constraint.
\subsubsection{Software System Attributes}
Availability: The system will be running constantly.  \\ \\
Security: The system's security and reliability is mentioned in Section 2.4 \\ \\ 
Maintainability: PGO will be admin and be able to create and archive users. \\
After testing and feedback, the developers would be able to update the system to suit the user's needs.
\section{Design}
\subsection{Choice of a Software Development Life-Cycle}
\subsubsection{SCRUM}
SCRUM is our choice of a software development life-cycle for our project. It is an agile development method which is iterative and incremental.
This is how we plan to implement it:
\begin{itemize}
\item We will create a wish list of use cases and add them to our backlog.
\item During sprint planning, we will pull some of the use cases from the backlog and add them to our sprint backlog, and then decide how to implement those use cases.
Our sprint time is 2 - 3 weeks, depending on the team's availability. 
\item Along the way, the ScrumMaster (Project Leader) keeps the team focused on its goal.
\item At the end of the sprint, the use cases should be implemented and work to the best of its ability. 
\item The sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective.
As the next sprint begins, we will choose more use cases from the backlog and begin working again. \cite{Scrum}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Choice of Architecture}
\subsubsection{Three Tier Architecture}
\textbf{DESCRIPTION OF ARCHITECTURE} \\
\includegraphics[scale=1]{Capture2.png} 
\begin{itemize}
\item A Presentation Layer that sends content to browsers in the form of HTML/JS/CSS. 
\item An Application Layer that uses an application server and processes the business logic for the application. This might be written in C\# or JavaScript.
\item A Data Layer which is a database management system that provides access to application data. This will be Microsoft SQL Server (IIS Server). \\
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Benefits}
\begin{itemize}
\item It gives you the ability to update the technology stack of one tier, without impacting other areas of the application.
It allows for team members to each work on their own areas of expertise.
\item You are able to scale the application up and out. A separate back-end tier, for example, allows you to deploy to a variety of databases instead of being locked into one particular technology. It also allows you to scale up by adding multiple web servers.
\item It adds reliability and more independence of the underlying servers or services.
\item It provides an ease of maintenance of the code base, managing presentation code and business logic separately, so that a change to business logic, for example, does not impact the presentation layer. \cite{tier}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Front-end Interface Method}
A web application which allows for browser support will be created. There it should work on most browsers including mobile browsers.
\subsection{Back-End Service}
ASP.net MVC uses SQL Server and we will use a local database (IIS Server) to store out details.
\subsection{Other Supporting Software}
Bootstrap will also be used to make sure that the web app looks good and works on all browsers. \\
\subsection{Student Responsibilities}
\begin{itemize}
\item Abdulkadir Dere - Group Leader
\item Brenda Lin - Quality Assurance
\item Jesse Wright - Technical Lead
\item Liam Leibrandt - Analysis Lead
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation (User Manual)}

\section{Testing}
\subsection{Functionality Testing}
\subsubsection{Motivation for Functionality Testing} 
Functionality testing is very important because it allows us to check and ensure that all functions that we have implemented for our system’s use
cases, are running correctly. This ensures that the data passed from users through the functions (via field forms) to the database is accurate and
without errors. This also allows us to determine if any use cases/processes contain faulty logic or flow so that we may review and alter them. 
\subsubsection{Case Name: Create a New Application} 
Requirement Description: The student should be able to create an application. \\

\end{tabu}
\subsection{Interface Testing}
\subsubsection{Motivation for Interface Testing} 
Interface testing is very important because this is the view that our end-user interacts with in order to use the functionality of our system. We have to ensure that the interface features, components and tools run correctly. We have to ensure that the user is never confused as to how to use our system and its functions. If our interface is not user-friendly then it is highly unlikely that anyone would make use of our web-
application.
\subsection{Security Testing}
\subsubsection{Motivation for Security Testing} 
Security testing is the process of testing the system to highlight the flaws and bugs within the system with regards to confidentiality, integrity, authentication, authorisation, availability and non-repudiation. //
Security testing is important as it maintains the systems intended functionality. It also analysis the system for any weaknesses, technical flaws or vulnerabilities.
\subsection{User Acceptance Testing (UAT)}
\subsubsection{Motivation for User Acceptance Testing} 
The user of the software product performs User Acceptance Testing (UAT). The acceptance criteria is specified for a given scenario to test that certain scenario. This test is important so we can evaluate the software under actual business or real-world scenarios to check if the software meets the requirements requested by the client. If a certain scenario fails the test then the results will be analysed to classify the priority of each scenario.\\ \\
This testing method will highlight if any feature of the system is not working. The team will use the results to reconfigure these processes.
\subsection{Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing}
\subsubsection{Motivation for Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing} 
Cross browser testing is the process of testing a web application across different browsers to ensure that a web application works as intended across multiple browsers since certain components might work differently on different web browsers. \\ \\
We shall test our web application on the following web browsers: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Microsoft Edge version 40.15063.0.0
\item Google Chrome version 60.0.3112.113
\item Mozilla Firefox version 55.0.3 
\end{itemize}
Desktop Browser tests have been conducted on Windows 10 operating system. \\ \\
Mobile Browser tests have been conducted on Android 7.0 Nougat operating system. 
\subsubsection{Case Name: Check Cross-Browser Compatibility}
Requirement Description: The system should be compatible with different types of browsers. \\ \\

\subsection{Test Summary}
Cross Browser Compatibility Test was successful for all the specified browsers except Microsoft Edge. Microsoft Edge does not display the Date Picker. So, the user cannot view Date Picker hence they can’t select a date. This feature works well with other browsers. After analyses and research, we have found that Microsoft Edge has default style and selector for date. The default style takes precedence over additional styling done through the plugin. The user can still enter a date manually with the format of “yyyy/mm/dd”. This is problematic as the does not know the format hence will not be able to enter the correct date format. This issue is noted and will be fixed in construction phase.
