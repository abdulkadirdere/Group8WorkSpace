\section*{Project Description}
Our aim for the project is to create an online postgraduate application approval system for
the school of electrical and information engineering. This system will be completely
paperless to keep the paperwork of the activity to a minimum. \\
The PGO will receive completed applications from students and required documents from
SIMS. These applications will be checked to make sure they are ready to process. Once they
are checked, the applications with the required information can be sent to one of the three
users that will either recommend or not recommend an application. The three actors are
the Research Group Lead, Identified Supervisor and the PGC. The application will be sent to
either one of these actors based on the program that the application is for. If an interview is
needed, one of the three actors can book an interview with the applicant. After the
interview the user can recommend/not recommend the application. The application will
then be sent to the PGC who will then accept or reject the application based on the the
application being recommended or not and based on faculty rules and regulations. The
PGFO will receive an email/notification about the application's status. The applicant and the
school’s PGO will also receive an email notifying them whether the application was accepted
or rejected with an explanation.

\section*{Project Tasks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Back-end: Send PGO a notification for applications to be approved.
\item Back-end: Downloads required documents from SIMS.
\item Back-end: Check applications to make sure there is nothing missing and there is no
errors.
\item Back-end: Send Research Group Lead, Identified Supervisor or PGC the application
with relevant documents, based on on program.
\item Back-end: Send notification email to applicant for interview.
\item Back-end: Send the application, with relevant documents, to the PGC for acceptance
or rejection.
\item Back-end: Verify the application based on faculty rules and regulations.
\item Back-end: Update SIMS and notify PGFO.
\item Back-end: Send an email to the applicant and PGO notifying them about the
application status with explanation.
\item Front-end: PGO should receive notifications for applications that need to be
approved.
\item Front-end: The three actors should only be able to see the relevant applications with
the required information based on the type of application.
\item Front-end: Actor needs to have the option to send the applicant an email of all the
details (date, time and venue) regarding the interview.
\item Front-end: If an interview is needed, the actor can only recommend/not recommend
an application once the interview has been conducted.
\item Front-end: The relevant actor needs to be able to recommend/not recommend an
application if no interview is needed.
\item Front-end: PGC will need to be able to receive a notification and will be able to see
all recommended/not recommended applications - in which he will then accept or
reject the application based on the recommendation with an explanation.
\item Front-end: The PGFO will receive a notification about applications’ status.
\end{itemize}
